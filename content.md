EYEBROW / POSITIONING LINE
AI capability, built in context — not in a classroom.

SECTION 1: THE HOOK
Headline: I have no engineering degree. No data science background. I built Accenture's flagship AI solution for sourcing and contracting anyway.
Body:
In 2023, I started teaching myself AI the only way I knew how: by building things that actually worked and putting them into production. No training programs. No certifications. Just a problem to solve and a refusal to wait for permission.
What came out of that was S2C IQ — Accenture's first purpose-built AI solution for source-to-contract. Within a year, deployed across 300+ practitioners and 140+ enterprise clients. Averaging 41% time saved per task. Recognized by Everest Group as part of Accenture's #1 Leader and Star Performer ranking in Procurement Outsourcing for 2025.
I didn't start as an expert. I became one by doing the work. That turned out to be the most important insight I'd develop.

SECTION 2: WHAT I LEARNED
Headline: Here's the thing most AI adoption programs get wrong.
Body:
After training hundreds of practitioners, I kept seeing the same pattern. People would complete a training. Return to their desks. And within weeks, revert to exactly how they worked before.
It wasn't a motivation problem. It wasn't a talent problem. It was a context problem.
AI fluency only develops when instruction is delivered in real work context — not in isolation from it.
A sourcing practitioner doesn't learn prompt engineering by reading about it. They learn it by prompting an AI to draft a supplier evaluation framework for a category they're actively managing — then refining it, building an agent that codifies it, and redesigning the workflow around it. The learning and the doing are the same activity.
When you separate them, the training evaporates. When you integrate them, you get Day 2 usage. Changed workflows. Outputs that are measurably better.
The tool doesn't matter as much as the methodology. I've seen this hold across Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT and countless tools and platforms since like Claude Code, Codex, AI Studio, whatever. The platform changes. The principles I learned persisted.

SECTION 3: THE NUMBERS BEHIND THE CLAIM
Headline: What this looks like at scale.
Body:
Across 300+ practitioners trained through this approach:
— Day 2 usage. Not "eventual adoption." People using AI on real work the next morning.
— 30–79% task-level speed improvements, measured across sourcing, contracting, category management, and supplier management functions.
— Quality uplift in the actual work product: stronger negotiation strategies, tighter contract terms, better supplier intelligence.
— Sustained behavioral change, not completion certificates.
Everest Group's 2025 PEAK Matrix assessment cited S2C IQ and TechTariff IQ — both solutions I built — as key differentiators in Accenture's AI innovation across source-to-contract. Accenture earned the Leader and Star Performer positions. I built the tools and the methodology behind that recognition.

SECTION 4: A THOUGHT FOR S2C LEADERS
Headline: No one had a head start. That's either a problem or an opportunity.
Body:
ChatGPT launched in November 2022. The current generation of AI tools became available to everyone at the same time — simultaneously, not sequentially. There was no period where AI expertise accumulated somewhere that organizations could simply buy access to.
Which means the AI capability gap forming right now isn't about who had more time. It's about who started learning earlier — and where they chose to do that learning.
The organizations that are pulling ahead built AI fluency into how their people actually work. Not through training programs that run parallel to the job. Through redesigning the work itself.
That's the only thing I've seen produce results that last.

SECTION 5: CONNECT
Headline: If this resonates, I'd like to connect.
Body:
I write about AI capability building in source-to-contract — what works, what doesn't, and what I'm still figuring out. If you're a procurement leader, practitioner, or just someone thinking hard about how organizations actually develop AI fluency rather than just access it — follow along or reach out on LinkedIn.
